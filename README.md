## Setup and Installation

### Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mhasan341/HCTakeHomeChallenge.git
cd HCTakeHomeChallenge
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
### Now we have two repositories

```bash
cd Laravel
cp .env.example .env
composer install
```
Edit the .env and add a database

### Seeding is important as it creates some permissions and other data to be used.
```bash
php artisan migrate --seed

php artisan key:generate

php artisan serve
```

(optional)
For any permission related issue, please provide permission to the following folder.

```bash
chmod -R 775 storage
chmod -R 775 bootstrap/cache
```

- **Error Handling**
- **Testing**: 97.85% code is covered (80 Tests, 267 assertions in total), including the CRUDs and we can still do more as we don't have enough time to cover all edge cases. Few files are ignored at this moment.
